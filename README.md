# PumpkinPi - Sample Code

Here you will find three different code examples to get you started with the PumpkinPi from ModMyPi.

There is either a [kit you can build](https://www.modmypi.com/raspberry-pi/led-displays-and-drivers-1034/led-boards-1040/halloween-pumpkin-solder-kit) or a [pre-assembled Pumpkin](https://www.modmypi.com/raspberry-pi/led-displays-and-drivers-1034/led-boards-1040/halloween-pumpkin-programmable-kit) for you to get your Halloween spook on with.

### all_on.py

As the name of the file implies, this simply turns on all the LEDS on the board.

### ants.py

This script simply turns each led on then off in sequence.

### random_leds.py

This script will randomly turn on/off the leds at random brightnesses.
